=== Intent

CQRS Command Query Responsibility Segregation - Separate the query side from the command side.

=== Applicability

Use the CQRS pattern when

* you want to scale the queries and commands independently.
* you want to use different data models for queries and commands. Useful when dealing with complex domains.
* you want to use architectures like event sourcing or task based UI.
