=== Intent

Page Object encapsulates the UI, hiding the underlying UI widgetry of an application (commonly a web application) and providing an application-specific API to allow the manipulation of UI components required for tests. In doing so, it allows the test class itself to focus on the test logic instead.

=== Applicability

Use the Page Object pattern when

* You are writing automated tests for your web application and you want to separate the UI manipulation required for the tests from the actual test logic.
* Make your tests less brittle, and more readable and robust
