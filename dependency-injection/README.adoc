=== Intent

Dependency Injection is a software design pattern in which one or
more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a
dependent object (or client) and are made part of the client's state. The
pattern separates the creation of a client's dependencies from its own
behavior, which allows program designs to be loosely coupled and to follow the
inversion of control and single responsibility principles.

=== Applicability

Use the Dependency Injection pattern when

* when you need to remove knowledge of concrete implementation from object
* to enable unit testing of classes in isolation using mock objects or stubs
