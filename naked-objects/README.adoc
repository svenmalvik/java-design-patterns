=== Intent

The Naked Objects architectural pattern is well suited for rapid
prototyping. Using the pattern, you only need to write the domain objects,
everything else is autogenerated by the framework.

* an autogenerated user interface is good enough
* you want to automatically publish the domain as REST services
