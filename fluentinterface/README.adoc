==  - Functional

== Intent

A fluent interface provides an easy-readable, flowing interface, that often mimics a domain specific language. Using this pattern results in code that can be read nearly as human language.

== Implementation

A fluent interface can be implemented using any of

* Method Chaining - calling a method returns some object on which further methods can be called.
* Static Factory Methods and Imports
* Named parameters - can be simulated in Java using static factory methods.

== Applicability

Use the Fluent Interface pattern when

* you provide an API that would benefit from a DSL-like usage
* you have objects that are difficult to configure or use
