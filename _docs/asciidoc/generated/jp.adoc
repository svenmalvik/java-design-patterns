== Java Design Patterns

=== Bridge
++++
Composition over inheritance. The Bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.
 With Bridge, you can decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

 In Bridge pattern both abstraction ({@link Weapon}) and implementation (
 {@link Enchantment}) have their own class hierarchies. The interface of the implementations
 can be changed without affecting the clients.

 In this example we have two class hierarchies. One of weapons and another one of enchantments. We can easily
 combine any weapon with any enchantment using composition instead of creating deep class hierarchy.
