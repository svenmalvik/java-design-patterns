=== Intent

In most integration cases there is a need to monitor the messages flowing through the system. It is usually achieved
by intercepting the message and redirecting it to a different location like console, filesystem or the database.
It is important that such functionality should not modify the original message and influence the processing path.

=== Applicability

Use the Wire Tap pattern when

* You need to monitor messages flowing through the system
* You need to redirect the same, unchanged message to two different endpoints/paths
