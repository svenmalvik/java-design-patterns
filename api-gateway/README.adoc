=== Intent

Aggregate calls to microservices in a single location: the API Gateway. The user makes a single
call to the API Gateway, and the API Gateway then calls each relevant microservice.

Use the API Gateway pattern when

* you're also using the Microservices pattern and need a single point of aggregation for your
microservice calls
