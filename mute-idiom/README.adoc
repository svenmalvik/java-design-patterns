=== Intent

Provide a template to suppress any exceptions that either are declared but cannot occur or should only be logged;
while executing some business logic. The template removes the need to write repeated `try-catch` blocks.

=== Applicability

Use this idiom when

* an API declares some exception but can never throw that exception eg. ByteArrayOutputStream bulk write method.
* you need to suppress some exception just by logging it, such as closing a resource.
