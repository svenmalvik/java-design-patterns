- Difficulty: Beginner

=== Intent

Servant is used for providing some behavior to a group of classes.
Instead of defining that behavior in each class - or when we cannot factor out
this behavior in the common parent class - it is defined once in the Servant.

=== Applicability

Use the Servant pattern when

* when we want some objects to perform a common action and don't want to define this action as a method in every class.
