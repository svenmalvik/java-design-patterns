Token

=== Intent

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an
object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

=== Applicability

Use the Memento pattern when

* a snapshot of an object's state must be saved so that it can be restored to that state later, and
* a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation
