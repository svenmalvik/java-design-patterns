=== Intent

To avoid expensive re-acquisition of resources by not releasing
the resources immediately after their use. The resources retain their identity, are kept in some
fast-access storage, and are re-used to avoid having to acquire them again.

=== Applicability

Use the Caching pattern(s) when

* Repetitious acquisition, initialization, and release of the same resource causes unnecessary performance overhead.
