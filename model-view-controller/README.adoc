=== Intent

Separate the user interface into three interconnected components:
the model, the view and the controller. Let the model manage the data, the view
display the data and the controller mediate updating the data and redrawing the
display.

=== Applicability

Use the Model-View-Controller pattern when

* you want to clearly separate the domain data from its user interface representation
