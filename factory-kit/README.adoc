=== Intent

Define a factory of immutable content with separated builder and factory interfaces.

=== Applicability

Use the Factory Kit pattern when

* a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
* you just want a new instance of a custom builder instead of the global one
* you explicitly want to define types of objects, that factory can build
* you want a separated builder and creator interface
